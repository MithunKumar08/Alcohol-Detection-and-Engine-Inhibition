# Alcohol-Detection-and-Engine-Inhibition
The Alcohol Detection and Engine Inhibition System is designed to enhance road safety by preventing individuals under the influence of alcohol from operating a vehicle. This project leverages sensor technology to detect the presence of alcohol and integrates with the vehicle's engine control system to inhibit engine start if alcohol is detected.

# Installation and Usage
Sensor Installation: Mount the alcohol sensor in a position where it can effectively sample the driver's breath (e.g., near the steering wheel).
Wiring: Connect the sensor and microcontroller to the vehicle's electrical system and ignition circuit.
Configuration: Program the microcontroller with the provided code and calibrate the sensor for accurate detection.
Operation: Once installed, the system will automatically monitor alcohol levels and inhibit engine start if alcohol is detected.

# Benefits
Enhanced Safety: Reduces the risk of drunk driving incidents by preventing vehicle operation under the influence.
Compliance: Assists in adhering to legal regulations regarding alcohol consumption and driving.
Peace of Mind: Provides drivers and their families with confidence in their safety on the road.
