# Alcohol-Detection-and-Engine-Inhibition
The Alcohol Detection and Engine Inhibition System is designed to enhance road safety by preventing individuals under the influence of alcohol from operating a vehicle. This project leverages sensor technology to detect the presence of alcohol and integrates with the vehicle's engine control system to inhibit engine start if alcohol is detected.
